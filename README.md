# Custom Tokenization

This project demonstrates a simple custom tokenization utility in JavaScript. It includes a tokenizer function and a small demo to show its usage.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or copy the project files.
2. Navigate to the `customTokenization` directory:
   ```zsh
   cd customTokenization
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```zsh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

Run the demo script to see the tokenizer in action:

```zsh
node src/index.js
```

## Demo

The demo in `src/index.js` shows how to use the custom tokenizer to split a sample text into tokens. You can modify the input string or tokenization logic as needed.
